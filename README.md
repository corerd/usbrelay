USB Relay driver for Linux, Mac OS X and Windows
================================================

A cheap USB relay available from Ebay has either single or dual relay output.
The double throw relay ratings are 10A 250VAC each.

The USB device is HID compatible and comes with Windows control software.
This code can control the relay vi HIDAPI which is a cross platform library. 
This code was tested under linux both on x86 and Raspberry Pi ARM.
The program is command line only as it is likely to be used by shell scripts.

The output of lsusb for the device is:
```
Bus 001 Device 003: ID 16c0:05df Van Ooijen Technische Informatica HID device except mice, keyboards, and joysticks

HIDAPI
======

http://www.signal11.us/oss/hidapi

HIDAPI is a fairly recent addition to linux and is available as a package for Fedora 20 but not for Pidora (F18). 
The package was built for Pidora (Fedora 18) using the F20 hidapi source package.

Protocol:
The relay modules does not set the USB serial number but has a unique serial when the HID device is queried, the current state of the relays is also sent with the serial.
The HID serial is matched and the ON/OFF command is sent to the chosen relay.


Build Instructions
===================

Prerequisites
-------------

You will need to install development packages for libhidapi.

On Windows, checkout hidapi sources from the official repository:

https://github.com/signal11/hidapi

From the above link. follow the instructions to build the hidapi dll.

For your convenience, you can find the hidapi library binaries in this repo
in the `windows/hidapi` directory.


Linux
-----

On Debian/Ubuntu systems, development packages for libhidapi can be installed by running:
```
sudo apt-get install libhidapi-dev libhidapi-hidraw0 libhidapi-libusb0
```

There are two options for the hidapi library: hidapi-hidraw or hidapi-libusb. Different distributions have better results with one or the other. YMMV.

```
### hidapi-hidraw 
# gcc -o usbrelay usbrelay.c -lhidapi-hidraw
### hidapi-libusb
# gcc -o usbrelay usbrelay.c -lhidapi-libusb
```


Mac OS X
--------

On Mac OS X, development packages for libhidapi can be installed by running:
```
sudo brew install hidapi
```

Compile the program entering the following command:
```
# gcc -o usbrelay usbrelay.c -lhidapi
```


Windows
-------

Use Visual Studio to build the .sln file in the `windows/usbrelay-vs` directory.


Usage
=====

As already stated, the program is command line only.

On Linux, the code needs to access the device. This can be achieved either by running the program with root privileges (so sudo is your friend) or by putting
```
SUBSYSTEM=="usb", ATTR{idVendor}=="16c0",ATTR{idProduct}=="05df", MODE="0666"
KERNEL=="hidraw*", ATTRS{busnum}=="1", ATTRS{idVendor}=="16c0", ATTRS{idProduct}=="05df", MODE="0666"
```
to `/etc/udev/rules.d/50-dct-tech-usb-relay-2.rules`.

Usually hidraw busnum is set to 1, but it may change in some hardware configurations, such as virtual machines.
Check the output of the `lsusb` command to get the right hidraw busnum.

Running the program will display each module that matches device 16c0:05df the debug information is sent to stderr while the state is sent to stdout for use in scripts. The only limit to the number of these relays that can be plugged in and operated at once is the number of USB ports.

The following examples run the program on a Linux shell with root privileges.
If udev rules have been added, then you can omit the `sudo` prefix.

On Mac OS X and Windows, it is not required to run the program with root privileges.
```
$ sudo ./usbrelay
Device Found
  type: 16c0 05df
  path: /dev/hidraw1
  serial_number: 
  Manufacturer: www.dcttech.com
  Product:      USBRelay2
  Release:      100
  Interface:    0
PSUIS_1=1
PSUIS_2=0
```
To get the relay state
```
$ sudo ./usbrelay 2>/dev/null
PSUIS_1=1
PSUIS_2=0
```
To use the state in a script:
```
$ eval $(sudo ./usbrelay 2>/dev/null)
$ echo $PSUIS_2
0
```
To set the relay state of 1 or more modules at once:
```
$ sudo ./usbrelay PSUIS_2=0
$ sudo ./usbrelay PSUIS_2=1 PSUIS_1=0
$ sudo ./usbrelay PSUIS_2=0 PSUIS_1=1 0U70M_1=0 0U70M_2=1
```
If for some reason the USB id changes, (ie other than 16c0:05df) set the USBID environment variable to the correct ID
```
$sudo USBID=16c0:05df ./usbrelay
```

Enjoy
